        <h1><b>Designing an Infographic for Computational Thinking</b></h1>

        <p>For this project, I set out to create an engaging and
            educational infographic that highlights the fundamental elements
            of Computational Thinking:
            <b>Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Algorithm Design, and Abstraction.</b>
            The goal was to present these concepts in a clear and visually appealing
            way that makes them accessible and easy to understand for a broad audience.
            Each element of Computational Thinking is accompanied by a brief but informative
            description of what that element signifies.
        </p>
        <p>To bring this project to life, I used Adobe Express, which provided me
            with a versatile platform to blend strong visuals with informative content.
            The design process involved selecting appropriate layouts, color schemes, and typography
            to create a balance between aesthetics and clarity. Through this, I learned how critical
            design choices affect the readability and overall impact of educational materials.
        </p>
        <p><b>Tools Used:</b> Adobe Express</p>
        <p>Beyond mastering the technical aspects of Adobe Express, this project
            deepened my appreciation for Computational Thinking as an essential skill set
            in technology and software development. Breaking down complex problems into
            manageable parts (Decomposition), spotting recurring patterns (Pattern Recognition),
            creating step-by-step solutions (Algorithm Design), and focusing on relevant details
            while ignoring irrelevant information (Abstraction) are foundational to developing
            efficient and effective applications.
        </p>
        <p>Working on this infographic also enhanced my ability to communicate
            technical ideas visually, a skill that is invaluable for bridging the
            gap between complex concepts and diverse audiences. Overall, this project
            reinforced the importance of Computational Thinking not just as an academic
            topic, but as a practical framework that underpins much of the work that I
            aspire to do in the technical field
